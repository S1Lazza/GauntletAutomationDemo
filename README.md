# Gauntlet Demo

This project showcases the **Gauntlet Automation Framework** integrated into Unreal Engine, demonstrating its functionality across multiple platforms and illustrating how to extract performance data from target applications.

## Additional Notes

- For additional details, requirements, and setup instructions, refer to the branch corresponding to the desired Unreal Engine version.
- Gauntlet requires a source code version of Unreal Engine to be used. The source code can be found at the official **Epic Games Github**, more info [here](https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup)
